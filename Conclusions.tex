Our tool-generated implementation approach offers a simpler approach to achieve performance portability and energy efficiency across multiple cores, accelerators and GPU cards. Although domain experts may find it difficult at first to create a specification as input, we find that the recursive algorithms' close resemblance to the spec effectively overcomes this obstacle. Experimenting with various Hardware configurations, such as DNN accelerators and GPU-enabled single and multi-card servers, demonstrated the efficacy of our tool-based approach. Our work provides a peek into the energy consumption, latency, and speed of development to help developers deploy their matrix-multiplication based applications on an appropriate workhorse.
